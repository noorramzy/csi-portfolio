        The most intriguing make-sense experience I had over the course of the semester was when we were creating the first round of attribute spectrums, after interviewing three of our four interviewees. We had conducted the interviews in the weeks prior, and our team had taken notes on the background of each interviewee, along with their current work. I felt as if we had a very good understanding of each character, as we had learned a lot about each of them through the interviews. 
        However, as we constructed our attribute spectrums, I realized that I did not fully understand what information we collected in the “soak” portion of the process, or even in the “squeeze” portion.

              Two of the people we interviewed, dubbed Manny McManus and Jacob Gong, were both civil engineers, unlike the contractor and architect we interviewed later on. Additionally, McManus and Gong both had been working in the field of construction for many years. They both worked for large corporations, and did commercial construction, as opposed to the other two interviewees who had a greater focus on residential. 
        As they spoke, both McManus and Gong discussed issues with zoning, planning, and organizing clients and subcontractors. Because of their similarities, I assumed that the traits which we discovered of these two interviewees would be similar as well. However, as we started to look deeper into the notes we took, and discuss as a group the attributes of each interviewee, conducting a proper “squeeze”, we realized that the two people had very different attributes. 
        As we created their person portraits, we highlighted specific points, such as quotations about their passions, and specific roles they talked about playing in their respective jobs. These portraits started to allow us to see the differences between McManus and Gong, but they still had similar overall themes.

       Until the “make sense” portion of the project, I did not have a full understanding of each person we interviewed. However, as we started to create attribute spectrums and two-by-twos, we looked deeper into the different people interviewed and started to draw connections between the different aspects of each person, such as their background, dislikes, and roles. 
        The images above are examples of the early-stage two-by-twos and attribute spectrums which we created and began planning, some of which clearly show McManus (CM or M) and Gong (JG or G) on opposite or contrasting ends of the spectrums.

        Looking for the connections in order to create the frameworks, such as our initial attribute spectrums and two by-twos made me realize how the many tiny details which we had been observing can be just as influential as the big picture details which we assumed were most impactful in shaping a person’s experience and overall traits. 
        We noticed, for instance, that McManus talked much more about managing his employees in the office, but in a way that provided guidance to young engineers. On the other hand, Gong talked about managing employees in the office, but he talked about more specific technical details, which when analyzed critically, illuminated to us how McManus is more team-oriented than Gong, even though both of them worked in management, in very similar companies.

         This experience made me look at the information we gathered more critically, and pay more attention to the minute details we could extract, such as whether the person mentioned their family or other hobbies to indicate what type of hours they work, or whether they talked about contractors or not to see whether they prefer management or design, to understand their character and better create accurate personas. This insight should also allow my group to better utilize these minute details to design a useful and more impactful product for our user group.
